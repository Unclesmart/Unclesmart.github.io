            <h2>Kenya my motherland, Africa my Continent</h2>
            <p class="quote">
                The aim of this research was to assess the implementation of the Kenya e-Citizen project
                hence propose a model that can be generalized to other government initiatives in Kenya. This
                research was based on a case study, which entailed collecting data in Nairobi through
                interviews and questionnaires from four key ministries and the general users/citizens. The
                questionnaires and interview guides were created based on the six dimensions of the updated
                DeLone and McLean of Information Systems Success model. An integrated model for
                assessing successful implementation of ICT projects was developed. The proposed model
                consists of all the dimensions found in the updated DeLone and McLean model, and an
                additional dimension; stakeholder engagement, which the study felt needed to be added. The
                study concludes by emphasizing on the need of stakeholder engagement during the life of any
                ICT project.
